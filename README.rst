TYPO3 to Slack

This is a small wrapper Extension for "Slack for PHP" from Regan McEntyre (https://github.com/maknz/slack)

**Slack for PHP**
A simple PHP package for sending messages to Slack with incoming webhooks...

Just Install and configure it in the ExtensionManager, there is a small Scheduler CommandController Task with a simple "Hello World" for testing and an own extension (t3_slack_examples) with some coding examples.
